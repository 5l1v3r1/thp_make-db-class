# The Hacking Project - Database of an online education site


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to design a database for an online education site where : 
* There will be students who can register for only one course
* A course may have several students.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_make-db-class
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
